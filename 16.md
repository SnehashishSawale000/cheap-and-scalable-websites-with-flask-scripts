I. Build the blog

    % python generator.py build

II. Create the patch between the directories

    % diff -ruN -x '.git' -x 'CNAME' /path/to/blog/repo build > blog.diff

    Explanation:
    -r recursively diff the directories
    -u use the unified format (this is what git uses)
    -N create new files
    -x ignore files matching the given pattern (we are ignoring the CNAME file and everything in .git otherwise, diff will assume they were deleted)

III. Apply the patch to your github repo

    % cd /path/to/blog/repo
    % patch -p1 < /path/to/blog.diff

II-III (alternate instructions). You can also do the diff and patch in one line

    % cd /path/to/blog/repo
    % diff -ruN -x '.git' -x 'CNAME' . /path/to/build | patch -p1

IV. Commit the changes and push to github

V. Clean up

    - Remove the build directory
    - Remove the patch file (if one was created)

### Alternate Instructions

I. Clone my fork of [Frozen-Flask][frozen] and install it

    % git clone git@github.com:croach/Frozen-Flask.git
    % cd  Frozen-Flask
    % pip install -e .

II. Set the build destination directory to your github repo and ignore .git/* and CNAME

    +FREEZER_DESTINATION = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.pardir), 'croach.github.com')
    +FREEZER_IGNORED_FILES = ['.git', 'CNAME']

III. Now just build, commit, and push

    % python generator.py build
    % cd /path/to/blog/repo
    % git add . && git commit -m "Updated blog" && git push
