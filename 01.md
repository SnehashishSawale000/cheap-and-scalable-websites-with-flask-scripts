# Introduction

So you want to create a blog that can withstand the onslaught of traffic you're planning on getting when one of your posts makes it to the top of the Reddit homepage, and you want to do it on the cheap. So, how do you do it? Well you want to go static, or, a better term to describe the approach would be, pre-rendered.

If you've been paying attention for the last few years now, you've probably noticed a rise in the popularity of static blog generators, the most popular of which would be Jekyll. Now these tools are all really great, I myself used Jekyll for the past year to generate my blog, but I have two major problems with using these tools. The first is that you're essentially learning quite a lot about a very specialized tool, and not everything you learn is going to transferable to projects that don't use it. You're essentially learning a Domain Specific Language, and like any domain specific tool, it's uses will be limited to that specific domain.

The other problem, and it's closely related to the first, is that, being a domain specific tool, rather than a general purpose one, means that the it was designed with a very specific purpose in mind. As such, trying to use that tool for a project outside of its normal domain might be somewhat difficult, if not completley impossible. The question then becomes, if you're already a programmer, why not just use the tools that you're already familiar with? Rather than use someone else's static site generator, what if we used a regular general purpose language and normal web framework to create our static site? Doing so would mean that you have complete control over the project with absolutely none of the limitations forced on you by a domain specific tool. In addition to this, anything you learn while creating your website is immediately relevant to you whenever you're tasked with creating a more traditional, dynamic website. It's a win-win.

In this course, we're going to look into this option. We'll be using Python as our language and Flask for our web framework to create a static blog generator, and we'll see how to deploy our blog for free using GitHub pages or for relatively little cost using Amazon's S3 file storage service.

Everything that you learn along the way will be immediately useful beyond the creation of a personal website and blog. Flask is an excellent framework to know, and if you follow along with this course, you'll learn all about the basics so that you can use put it to use in all of your other web development work. Also, with a little ingenuity, you can use these tools to create websites that are dynamic and yet still possess the capability to scale cheaply. It's this reason that I refered to these websites earlier as pre-rendered rather than static and, at the end of this course, we'll take a look at a few real world examples and discuss how they were able to accomplish this feat.

If all this sounds too fantastic and you're in need of further convincing, or you'd just like a sneak peak at a few of the real world apps that we'll be discussing towards the end, take a look at [this article][npr] from NPR's newly minted apps team. In the article, Katie Zhu, one of the newest members of the team, describes how NPR is able to put up apps that can withstand being pummeled during high traffic events, such as the 2012 election and subsequent inaguration, and they do it with only two servers. Yeah, that's right, you heard me correctly---two servers. How do they do it? Well, the same way that we'll do our blog application; they use Flask and Python to write the app, then pre-render it to static files that are hosted on Amazon's S3. For anything dynamic, they use JavaScript to pull pre-rendered data from S3. So, all they need is S3 for their app, and a single separate server that runs periodic cron jobs to compile the dynamic data into a JSON file that's also hosted on S3. Using this paradigm, the NPR team is capable of doing things like showing live election results without ever having a running server application in the background.

So, if you've ever wanted to create websites that could stand up to any amount of traffic on a shoestring budget, or you're just interested in learning how to use Flask, you're in the right place, and I hope you enjoy the course. So, let's not waste anymore time talking, let's get right down to building.
