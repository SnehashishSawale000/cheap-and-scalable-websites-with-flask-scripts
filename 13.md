I. Install Frozen-Flask
    % pip install frozen-flask

II. Import the Freezer class and create an instance of it

     import datetime

     from flask import Flask, render_template, abort
    +from flask.ext import frozen
     from werkzeug import cached_property
     from werkzeug.contrib.atom import AtomFeed
     import markdown

     DOMAIN = 'myawesomeblog.com'

     app = Flask(__name__)
    +freezer = frozen.Freezer(app)
     blog = Blog(app, root_dir='posts', base_url='/blog/')

III. Freeze the blog

     if __name__ == '__main__':
    -    app.run(port=8000, debug=True)
    +    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == 'build':
    +        freezer.freeze()
    +    else:
    +        app.run(port=8000, debug=True)


    - At this point, you'll probably run in the following problem:

        MimetypeMismatchWarning: Filename extension of u'' (type application/octet-stream) does not match Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

      The reason for this is that the extension on the requested file (in this case, no extension) does not match the expected mimetype of the file which is text/html. There are two ways to fix this:

      One way is to actually add the '.html' extension to the 'post' view's route. This will rectify the difference between the requested file's extension and the exptected content type. The issue with this, is that Frozen Flask will determine the name of the file where the generated HTML will be saved through the requested URLs. What that means is that the URL for the 'Hello World' post, for example, will be /blog/2013/01/29/hello-world.html. You may be fine with this URL, but you may also want to have a prettier URL without the '.html' extension. If that's what you're after, you'll need to go with option two.

        -@app.route('/blog/<path:path>')
        +@app.route('/blog/<path:path>.html')
         def post(path):
             post = blog.get_post_or_404(path)
             return render_template('post.html', post=post)


      This option solves the build problem by simply adding a slash to end of the 'post' view's route. The reason this works is that if the URL has a trailing slash, it is assumed that the request is for a directory and so the requested file is actually the default index.html file within the directory. Thus the generated file should be saved into an index.html file which will give a pretty URL like /blog/2013/01/29/hello-world and this solution looks like this:

        -@app.route('/blog/<path:path>')
        +@app.route('/blog/<path:path>/')
         def post(path):
             post = blog.get_post_or_404(path)
             return render_template('post.html', post=post)

IV. Let's test our build

    % cd build
    % python -mSimpleHTTPServer
