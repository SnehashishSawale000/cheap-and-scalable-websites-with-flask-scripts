## Chapter 1 Getting Started

### 1 - Introduction ()

We'll begin by answering the two most basic questions you should have when deciding whether or not to spend your time learning a new technology: "What is it?" and "Why learn it?". Why would you want to use it over Django? Also, point the user to the Python Power Tools video on virtuanenv and virtualenvwrapper.

## Chapter 6 The Right to Vote

### 12 - Using AJAX (17:27:08)

The term AJAX was coined shortly before the public release of the Django framework. Unfortunately, given the timing of the two technologies, the ability to simply perform an AJAX request was not something initially baked into Django. As a result, many have found it difficult to get started creating modern web applications with Django. Fortunately for us though, not only is it possible, it's actually quit simple once you understand a few things about how Django handles form posts. In this video, we'll cover all you need to know to add AJAXy functionality to your web applications by adding in the ability to vote on stories to our Hacker News clone.
