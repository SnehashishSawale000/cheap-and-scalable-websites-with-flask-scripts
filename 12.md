I. Discuss [Flask Snippets][snippets] and using Werkzeug within Flask
    - Flask snippets is a place where anyone can drop helpful pieces of code for others to use.
    - The author of Flask (Armin Ronacher) has a snippet that he's contributed demonstrating how to [generate an atom feed in Flask][atom]
    - This script demonstrates how to use the underlying Werkzeug library within your Flask application.

II. Import the FlaskFeed class and create the route for the feed

     from flask import Flask, render_template, abort
     from werkzeug import cached_property
    +from werkzeug.contrib.atom import AtomFeed
     import markdown
     import yaml

    +@app.route('/feed.atom')
    +def feed():
    +    pass
    +

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(port=8000, debug=True)

III. Create the feed object
    - Two types of URLs:
        1) The URL for the feed
        2) The URL for the website (or for the portion of the website the feed represents)
    - Add the posts you want to the feed
        - We'll just add the last 10 posts, but you could change it to add posts based on time (e.g., last month only) or whatever you think is appropriate here.

     @app.route('/feed.atom')
     def feed():
    -    pass
    +    feed = AtomFeed('My Awesome Blog',
    +        feed_url='http://%s/%s/' % (DOMAIN, 'feed.atom'),
    +        url='http://%s' % DOMAIN,
    +        updated=datetime.datetime.now())
    +    for post in blog.posts[:10]: # Just show the last 10 posts
    +        try:
    +            post_title = '%s: %s' % (post.title, post.subtitle)
    +        except AttributeError:
    +            post_title = post.title
    +        post_url = 'http://%s/%s/%s' % (DOMAIN, 'blog', post.url)
    +
    +        feed.add(
    +            title=post_title,
    +            content=unicode(post.html),  # this could be a summary for the post
    +            content_type='html',
    +            author='Christopher Roach',
    +            url=post_url,
    +            updated=post.date,  # published is optional, updated is not
    +            published=post.date)
    +    return feed.get_response()
