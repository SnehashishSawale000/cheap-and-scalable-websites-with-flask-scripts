I. Create the app object
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # Talk about what the creation of the app object does; things like:
    #   - sets up path information (root, templates, static, etc.)
    #   - sets the config


    # TODO: Talk about how the config works in a latter episode
    #       - Two ways to do this:
    #           1) Through a config file - app.config.from_pyfile('settings.cfg')
    #               - You can also use app.config.from_envar('SETTINGS_FILE')
    #                 to point to a file containing your config settings
    #           2) Through a python module - app.config.from_object(__name__)
    #       - In either case, only upper case attributes are added to the config


II. Add a simple "Hello World!" view
    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello, World!'

III. Run the application
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(port=8000)
        # Talk about the option for running the app:
        #   - host: set to '0.0.0.0' to make it available externally, default to '127.0.0.1'
        #   - port: defaults to 5000
        #   - debug: Set to true to auto restart after a change
